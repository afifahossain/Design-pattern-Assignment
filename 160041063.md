# Design-pattern-Assignment
Composite design pattern
We used composite pattern for creating the villages. The class comps is the composite class which has three properties(name,color,size). With the combination of these three, different shapes are created. The shapes make up the trees, houses and watersources. And these make the entire village. There is 3 levels in these tree structure.
